Status
------

Very alpha, but probably usable if the functionality you need has been
implemented.

Currently very incomplete (only a small number of API calls are supported), but
the architecture seems sound. All remaining API calls have ``TODO`` notes.

There are some moderately comprehensive docstrings in the code, but proper
documentation still needs to be written.
