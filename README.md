Status
------

Currently very incomplete (only four API calls are supported), but the
architecture seems sound.

There are some moderately comprehensive docstrings in the code, but proper
documentation still needs to be written.

(There is not yet a package on PyPI because I want more API coverage before
making any kind of official release.)
