txTwitter
=========

A Twisted-based client library for Twitter's API.

Status
------

Currently very incomplete (only seven API calls, two of them streaming, are
supported), but the architecture seems sound. All remaining API calls have
``TODO`` notes.

There are some moderately comprehensive docstrings in the code, but proper
documentation still needs to be written.

(There is not yet a package on PyPI because I want more API coverage before
making any kind of official release.)
